    "    - **[Text classification](https://madewithml.com/topics/text-classification/)**: multi-class classification of movie genres using title, ratings, etc. You can also be very creative here and try to get more metadata like movie descriptions from online using the ids provided in the dataset.\n",
    "        - When you're developing your models, start with simple approaches first and then slowly add complexity. For example, start with analyzing the text as tokens and using [logistic regression](https://madewithml.com/topics/logistic-regression/). Then explore [embeddings](https://madewithml.com/topics/embeddings/) with [CNNs](https://madewithml.com/topics/convolutional-neural-networks/) and [RNNs](https://madewithml.com/topics/recurrent-neural-networks/) and eventually attempt to use contextualized embeddings, pretrained [Transformers](https://madewithml.com/topics/transformers/) from [HuggingFace](https://madewithml.com/search-results/?tags=huggingface), etc.\n",
    "\n",
    "    - **Miscellaneous**: predict numerical statistics like revenue, popularity, etc. given title, genre, production companies, etc. Here you can start with simple models like [linear regression]() and then try out ensemble methods like [random forests]() and evetually use neural networks. If you have time, you can even explore more recent methods that offer the performance of large networks with the interpretability of simples models - for example: [TabNet](https://madewithml.com/projects/1001/tabnet-attentive-interpretable-tabular-learning/) or [Neural Backed Decision Trees](https://madewithml.com/projects/659/neural-backed-decision-trees/)."

    "    - [**Recommendation systems**](https://madewithml.com/topics/recommendation-systems/): recommend a movie based on liked movies. There are a lot of different approaches here but the most common technique will be content based. Ask the user to select movies that they like (from the dataset) and then recommend similar movies (based on genres, ratings, cast, crew, etc.) that they'd enjoy. \n",
    "\n",
    "    - [**Text generation**](https://madewithml.com/topics/text-generation/): generate the `tagline` or `overview` from movie title, genre, poster image, etc. or vice versa. You should definitely leverage pretrained language models here and then you can fine-tune using text from this dataset. \n",
    "\n",
    "    - [**Named entity recognition**](https://madewithml.com/topics/named-entity-recognition/): identify entities in movie titles and descriptions. This dataset doesn't come with any labeled entities however you can use a trained NER model to extract relevant entites that model can handle. This isn't much of an application so if you do choose this project, we suggest extending this to things like few-shot NER using embeddings, etc.\n",
    "\n",
    "    - [**Few-shot learning**](https://madewithml.com/topics/few-shot-learning/): identify genres using one or just a few samples, also check out [self-supervision](https://madewithml.com/search-results/?tags=self-supervised-learning&tags=natural-language-processing) techniques in NLP where you can create meaningful tasks with the data that extract relevant signal from the latent space which can then be used for classification with very few samples.
